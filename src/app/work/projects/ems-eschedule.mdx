As a Senior Applications Engineer at EMS eSchedule from 2009 to 2015, I led full-lifecycle design, development, and maintenance of both server-side and client-side code for a mission-critical workforce management platform.
Partnering closely with leadership and end-users, I architected and delivered custom web modulesâ€”most notably a Document Library and Event Calendar. These modules garnered recognition in industry publications for their usability and stability.
I optimized SQL database schemas and queries to improve system performance and reliability, while also collaborating directly with prospects to build and update tailored pages that accelerated onboarding.
In addition to hands-on coding, I interviewed, mentored, and trained junior engineers, ensuring consistency in coding standards and smooth knowledge transfer across our development team.
