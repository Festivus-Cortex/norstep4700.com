FIXME: ADD IMAGES!

I joined MahiGaming in 2015 as a Game Developer and, over the years, grew into the role of Game Developer Group Lead, contributing to the company's rise as a global real-money gaming platform. From day one, I dived headfirst into a fast-paced, collaborative startup atmosphere, helping build more than 14 flagship games and contributing to over 40 HTML5 slot titles. Early on, I took ownership of our core casino service game engine—designing its architecture to handle millions of concurrent users, optimizing performance for rapid global rollouts, and ensuring rock-solid stability under heavy load.
One of my most rewarding projects involved transforming the audio pipeline across multiple game releases. Working alongside our sound designer, I engineered an adapter-based integration of third-party audio libraries, optimizing RAM usage and streamlining sound playback. To accelerate production, I also developed custom audio-testing tools so designers could preview and iterate on assets without waiting for full builds—dramatically shortening feedback loops. Though our main stack was HTML5/TypeScript/JavaScript, I leveraged my versatility to integrate C# plugins, WebGL shaders, and other tech as needed to deliver standout player experiences.
As the team expanded, my responsibilities evolved beyond code. By 2019, I was mentoring a team of up to five engineers—balancing day-to-day development with training new hires on workflows, conducting one-on-one coaching sessions, and participating in talent interviews. I led daily standups across remote offices, coordinated quarterly SMART-goal reviews, and tracked multidisciplinary milestones to keep each game on schedule. To streamline releases, I assisted with CI/CD pipelines using Docker, cutting manual overhead and enabling weekly deployments of hotfixes and feature updates.
Beyond development, I wore many hats including audio producer, IT support specialist. I traveled internationally to train overseas teams on our engine tools, represented MahiGaming at industry conferences to forge new partnerships, and helped implement JIRA and Confluence workflows that improved cross-department visibility.
Through my tenure at MahiGaming, I not only honed my technical and leadership skills but also helped shape a culture of innovation and quality. Whether optimizing the audio pipeline to elevate player immersion or mentoring junior engineers to grow into senior roles, I took pride in pushing boundaries and delivering polished, high-performing titles to a worldwide audience.
