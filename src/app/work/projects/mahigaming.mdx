## Years of Game Development Excellence at MahiGaming

I joined MahiGaming in 2015 as a Game Developer and over the years grew into the role of Game Developer Group Lead, greatly contributing to the company's rise as a global real-money gaming platform. From day one, I dived headfirst into a fast-paced, collaborative startup atmosphere, helping build more than 14 flagship games and contributing to over 40 HTML5 slot titles. Early on, I integrated into the team for our core casino service game engine—designing its architecture to handle millions of concurrent users, optimizing performance for rapid global rollouts, and ensuring rock-solid stability under heavy load.
One of my most rewarding projects involved transforming the audio pipeline across multiple game releases. Working alongside our sound designer, I engineered an adapter-based integration of third-party audio libraries, optimizing RAM usage and streamlining sound playback. To accelerate production, I also developed custom audio-testing tools so designers could preview and iterate on assets without waiting for full builds which dramatically shortened feedback loops. Though our main stack was HTML5/TypeScript/JavaScript and React.js, I leveraged my versatility to integrate C# plugins and other tech as needed to deliver standout player experiences.
As the team expanded, my responsibilities evolved beyond code. By 2019, I was mentoring a team of up to five engineers—balancing day-to-day development with training new hires on workflows, conducting one-on-one coaching sessions, and participating in interviews. I led daily product meetings across remote offices, coordinated quarterly SMART-goal reviews, and tracked multidisciplinary milestones to keep each game on schedule. To streamline releases, I assisted with CI/CD pipelines using Docker, cutting manual overhead and enabling weekly deployments of hotfixes and feature updates.
Beyond development, I wore many hats including audio producer and IT support specialist. I traveled internationally to train overseas teams on our engine tools, represented MahiGaming at industry conferences to forge new partnerships, and helped implement workflows that improved organizational visibility.
Through my tenure at MahiGaming, I not only honed my technical and leadership skills but also helped shape a culture of innovation and quality. Whether optimizing the audio pipeline to elevate player immersion or mentoring junior engineers to grow into senior roles, I took pride in pushing boundaries and delivering polished, high-performing titles to a worldwide audience.
