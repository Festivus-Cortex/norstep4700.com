As lead on A.V., I spearheaded the creation of a unique stealth game built around a “Sound to Light” mechanic, managing a cross-disciplinary team of sixteen to develop dynamic audio-visual experiences in Unity 3D.
I collaborated closely with composers to layer musical tracks that doubled as in-game powers, organized and implemented an extensive asset library,
and secured funding through publisher meetings and a successful Kickstarter campaign. This evolved to a commercial release on Steam in February 2015 and winning “Best Sensory Game” at RPI GameFest 2014.
I also established development processes by conducting code reviews, drafting contributor contracts, leading team and vendor meetings, and adapting the game through public playtests and user feedback.
