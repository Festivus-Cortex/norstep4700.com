---

As a dedicated technologist and scholar, I have consistently demonstrated my passion for mentorship and knowledge sharing through roles as a teaching assistant in game and audio programming, and by guiding junior engineers and colleagues throughout my career. I actively engage in the broader development and audio communities—presenting at conferences, participating in industry forums, and contributing to open-source discussions—to stay at the forefront of emerging trends and foster professional collaboration.
Beyond software, I manage a robust home lab environment—configuring servers, handling network administration, and overseeing virtualized systems—to continually sharpen my infrastructure and troubleshooting skills.
Driven by a lifelong curiosity, I’ve honed my expertise through hands-on tinkering, technical problem-solving, and creative audio experimentation with great passion.
