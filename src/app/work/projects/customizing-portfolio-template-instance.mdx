For this refresh of my professional portfolio, I transitioned from a Weebly template site to a fully custom Next.js and OnceUI implementation, leveraging open-source templates alongside my existing expertise in React.js, Webpack, and general web development.
I architected and deployed the site on self-managed hosting—handling server configuration, DNS setup, and deployment. I also integrated PDF display support and tweaked existing image and content rendering components for an improved user experience.
I also configured hosting security, performance optimizations, and ongoing maintenance processes.

## Audio-Reactive Effect Descriptions

### Mask Radius Animator

The mask follows your cursor and pulses to the beat, expanding with bass drops and contracting during quieter moments.
Creates a dynamic reveal effect that breathes with the music's low frequencies.

### Gradient Tilt Animator

The background gradient spins and rotates in response to the overall energy of the music.
Louder, more energetic moments cause faster rotation, creating a hypnotic swirling effect that mirrors the music's intensity.

### Gradient Scale Animator

The gradient morphs between wide and tall ellipses, responding to mid-range frequencies.
Bass notes make it expand horizontally while higher frequencies stretch it vertically, creating an organic,
breathing shape that dances with the rhythm.

### Gradient Position Animator

The gradient bounces and glides around the screen, tracking audio peaks and overall energy.
Like a visual heartbeat, it moves more dramatically during intense musical moments and settles during calmer passages.

### Dots Opacity Animator

The dot pattern fades in and out with mid-high frequencies, responding to vocals, synths, and harmonics.
Creates a shimmering, starfield effect that pulses with the melodic content of the music.

### Glitch Intensity Animator

Sharp, high-frequency sounds like hi-hats and cymbals trigger glitch effects.
The visual distortion intensity matches the treble content, adding digital chaos that syncs with the music's crispest elements.
