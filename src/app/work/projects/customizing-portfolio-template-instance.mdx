For this refresh of my professional portfolio, I transitioned from a Weebly template site to a fully custom Next.js and OnceUI implementation, leveraging open-source templates alongside my existing expertise in React.js, Webpack, and general web development.
I architected and deployed the site on self-managed hosting—handling server configuration, DNS setup, and deployment. I also integrated PDF display support and tweaked existing image and content rendering components for an improved user experience.
I also configured hosting security, performance optimizations, and ongoing maintenance processes.

FIXME: ADD BLURB ABOUT AUDIO VISUAL FEATURES
